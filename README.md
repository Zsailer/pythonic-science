Materials for Scientific Programming in Python Course at the UO

## Motivation

Programming skills are increasingly integral to all aspects of physical and biological research. Programming competency enables science because the researcher is not limited to “canned” analyses and approaches. Rather, a scientific programmer can flexibly learn, apply and alter existing software as needed to answer scientific questions. This includes conceiving of and analyzing big-data experiments, mining databases of chemical and biological data, performing image analyses, fitting non-standard models to data, and prototyping experiments in silico to facilitate experimental design. 

Given the explosion of open source scientific software packages and libraries, a small amount of programming knowledge can allow for highly sophisticated analyses. A researcher needs to be able to find already-available tools, set them up locally, and then write a small amount of code to apply these general tools to their specific question. 

This course aims to teach these general skills. Students will not learn specific software packages or statistical/computational theory. Rather, the goal is for them to gain basic proficiency in the powerful and extensible Python programming language and have the confidence and skills to identify existing software libraries to leverage to further their research. 

## Conceptual goals

By the end of the course, students should understand:

 * Basic python: data types, key words, control, functions and imports
 * Core python extensions for scientists: scipy, numpy, and jupyter
 * Strategies for dissecting problems and formulating solutions in code
 * Where to go to pick up skills in the future as the need arises

## Skill Goals

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

 * Write basic python programs from scratch
 * Identify existing libraries for a problem and learn how to use them
 * Generate arbitrarily complex custom plots
 * Manipulate scientific datasets of the following types (at a basic level):
   * High-throughput sequencing data 
   * Sequence data from databases such as NCBI
   * Chemical structure data from databases such as the PDB
   * Images
   * Videos

## Approach

Teach the students general programing skills through the lens of actual scientific problems. We'll spend two weeks covering the basic elements of programming, and then use real research tasks to hone, develop, and extend those basicskills.

### Implementation
Coding will be taught using a collaborative "pilot/co-pilot" model. Students work through exercises in class in pairs, trading between being "pilots" (actually typing) and "co-pilots" (watching and providing feedback). This fosters conversation (and thus material recall), collaborative problem solving, and helps separate the mechanics of coding from the concepts. 

### Schedule for the 10-week course

Programming and instruction will be done using the powerful and intuitive jupyter programming framework. 

1. Introduction to python
2. Introduction to python
3. Model regression (`numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`)
4. High-throughput data (`sklearn`)
5. Sequence data 
6. Chemical structural analysis (`pdb_tools`)
7. Image data (`pillow`,`skimage`)
8. Video data (`opencv`,`skvideo`)
9. Open project
10. Open project

`sympy`?

### Open Project
To help cement their skills and gain independence, students will develop a useful program that addresses a problem in their current research. The code must use a python library that the student identifies that we did not explicitly discuss in class.
