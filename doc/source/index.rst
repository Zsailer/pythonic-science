CH410/510 Scientific Computing
==============================

+ The class will meet Mon and Wed for 1 hr, and then Fri for 2 hr.  

+ In general, Mon and Wed will be instruction days where we cover new
  programming material.  Fri will be an open "lab" where you will work on 
  exercises in class. 

Contact
=======

+ Mike Harms (harms@uoregon.edu)
+ Zach Sailer (zsailer.uoregon.edu)

Conceptual Goals
================

By the end of the course, students should understand:

+ Basic python: data types, key words, control, functions and imports
+ Core python extensions for scientists: scipy, numpy, and jupyter
+ Strategies for dissecting problems and formulating solutions in code
+ Where to go to pick up skills in the future as the need arises

Skill Goals
===========

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

+ Write basic python programs from scratch
+ Identify existing libraries for a problem and learn how to use them
+ Generate arbitrarily complex custom plots
+ Simulate experimental sampling
+ Manipulate scientific datasets of the following types (at a basic level):
  + High-throughput sequencing data 
  + Chemical structure data from databases such as the PDB
  + Images

Grading
=======


Assignments
===========

+ In the first two weeks, there will be micro-homework sets, due at 11:59 pm
  each day.  The goal of these is to force you to practice programming in
  short stretches every day.  
+ There will be 7 labs.  We will start the labs on Fri in class.  They will
  be due the following Wed in class. 
+ Project prospectus (Due May 12)
+ `Final project <final-project.html>`_ (Due June 12)
