CH410/510 Scientific Computing
==============================

+ The class will meet Mon and Wed for 1 hr, and then Fri for 2 hr.  

+ In general, Mon and Wed will be instruction days where we cover new
  programming material.  Fri will be an open "lab" where you will work on 
  exercises in class.

+ Mike Harms (harms@uoregon.edu)
+ Zach Sailer (zsailer.uoregon.edu)

Conceptual Goals
================

By the end of the course, students should understand:

+ Basic python: data types, key words, control, functions and imports
+ Core python extensions for scientists: scipy, numpy, and jupyter
+ Strategies for dissecting problems and formulating solutions in code
+ Where to go to pick up skills in the future as the need arises

Skill Goals
===========

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

+ Write basic python programs from scratch
+ Identify existing libraries for a problem and learn how to use them
+ Generate arbitrarily complex custom plots
+ Simulate experimental sampling
+ Manipulate scientific datasets of the following types (at a basic level):
 + High-throughput sequencing data 
 + Chemical structure data from databases such as the PDB
 + Images

Assignments
===========

+ Project prospectus (Due May 12)
+ `Final project <final-project.html>`_ (Due June 12)

Weekly assignments
------------------

Option 1
........

There will be 8 labs.  We will start the labs on Fri in class.  They will
be due the following Wed in class. Most students in the course should take this
route.

Option 2
........

If you have a lot of programming experience, you might want to use this class
as an independent study course to dig into big programming project.  If this 
is true:

+ Starting in the third week, you may substitute github commits on your project
  for individual lab assignments. 
+ Rules:
 + You must have already submitted your prospectus and had it approved
 + You must make a public github repository for your project
 + You must make a substantial commit for the week.  
 + You must tell me you are taking this route each week.
 + You must still attend class.

Grading
=======

+ Labs will be graded based on whether they are turned in, whether we can run
  the notebook, and whether they notebooks give the right results.  
+ The final project will be graded according to the rubric given in the 
  `Final project description <final-project.html>`_.
