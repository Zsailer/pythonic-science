=============
Final Project
=============

The end goal of this course is that you will be able to build your
own software to solve your own problems.  To work on this, you will build
software to solve a problem or answer a question from your own research. I
hope you view this as an opportunity, rather than a burden.  The last two
weeks of class are going to be an open workshop where you can develop the
software.

Constraints
-----------
 + The problem should be real.
 + At the end of the day, the program you write should be useful.
 + The approach should be feasible.  This means it is not only mathematically
   possible, but that you can make significant progress on the project in a
   few weeks of coding.
 + The problem should **not** be one you could solve better and faster using
   an existing software package.  If you say you're going to write a
   transcriptome assembler, I'm going to point you to Trinity (unless you
   have reason to believe you can do better!)
 + If you need data to develop the program (e.g. experimental images, sequencing
   runs, etc.) these should already have been collected.

Resources
---------
 + **Definitely** use software packages that help you achieve your goals.  If
   you're analyzing colonies on a plate, use libraries like `PIL` and `skimage`
   --don't write your own image parser!
 + Talk to your lab mates and PI about interesting problems and what software
   might be useful.
 + Talk to Zach and me about strategies.  For example, if you want to classify
   stuff, machine learning might be the way to go.  We're not going to discuss
   it in detail in class, but Zach and I can point you to resources that will
   help you get started.

Project Ideas:
--------------
 + Counting/classifying something in an automated fashion
 + Fitting complicated model(s) to data
 + Squeezing every last drop of information out of a high-throughput experiment
 + Processing spectra
 + Pulling shapes out images
 + Tracking a particle in a video
 + Extract some cool feature out of an MD simulation
 + Machine learning to classify stuff


The prospectus is due on or before Wednesday, May 17th.  I will
review the proposal and discuss it with you one-on-one during one of
the in-class workshops.  The earlier you bring it in, the earlier you can get
rolling on the final project.  The point of the prospectus is to help you think
through the project, not to create busy work.  It does not have to be super
pretty, but it should have the following (bullet points are fine):

1. Identify a problem from your research that you will solve computationally.
2. Describe the strategy your program will use as a flow chart.  (Can be hand
   drawn, as long as it's legible).
3. Describe the data you will use to develop your program (for example: images
   from a control and treatment condition).
4. Describe how you will verify the program is actually doing what you want it
   to do.
5. Describe existing software that you can use to help solve the problem.

If there are issues that should be addressed, I might ask for a revised
version.
